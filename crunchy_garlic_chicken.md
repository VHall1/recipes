# Crunchy Garlic Chicken

### Ingredients & Tools

- 10g grated parmesan
- 3tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 large carlic clove, crushed
- 1 lemon, zested (Don't skip on the lemon, otherwise this dish will be missing a required acidic touch!)
- 1tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs
- 25g panko
- 1 chicken breast (cut into ~3 mini fillets)

- 2 bowls (ou can also use plastic containers)
- A few tablespoons (At least 2 for the dry/wet rotation)
- A baking tray (lined with parchment or foil if needed)

### Method

1. Heat the oven to 200C at least 10 minutes before putting the chicken in.
2. In the first dish, mix the parmesan, mayo, garlic, lemon zest, herbs and seasonings, to form a paste - a tablespoon does this well. In the second dish, add the 25g of panko breadcrumbs.
3. Before coating the chicken, make sure to dry it up with kitchen towel - this will help the coating to stick
4. Slide the first breast into the mayo mix and use the spoon to make sure it is coated all over and remove any excess. Now transfer that to the breadcrums bown and shake the bowl around to make sure the chicken is coated all over - a second tablespoon can be helpful here.
5. Once the fillet is fully trenched in the breadcrumbs, pick it up by the corner and gently pat it to remove any excess - be careful to not end up removing bits of the coating.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 with the remaining fillets, and transfer them to the baking tray once they are coated.
7. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden - Once they are done, I would recommended putting them in a separate cooling rack if you have one.
* I've tried combining this chicken with a creamy mash but that felt a bit too rich, so maybe simple roasted potatoes are your best bet here!
