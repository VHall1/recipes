# Crunchy Garlic Chicken

### Ingredients & Tools

- 10g grated parmesan
- 5tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 large carlic clove, crushed
- 1/2 lemon zested
- Herbs and spices
- 25g panko 
- 1 chicken breast (cut into mini fillets)

- 2 bowls (ou can also use plastic containers)
- A few tablespoons (At least 2 for the dry/wet rotation)
- A baking tray (lined with parchment or foil if needed)

### Method

1. Heat the oven to 200C at least 10 minutes before putting the chicken in.
2. In the first dish, mix the parmesan, mayo, garlic, lemon zest, herbs and seasonings to form a paste - a spoon can be helpful here. Add the panko breadcrumbs to the second dish
3. Before coating the chicken, make sure to dry it up with a kitchen towel as this will help the coating to stick
4. Slide the first breast into the mayo mix and use the spoon to make sure it is coated all over and remove any excess. Now transfer that to the breadcrums bown and shake the bowl around to make sure the chicken is coated all over
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the remaining fillets and transfer them to the baking tray once they are coated
7. Cook for ~25 to 30 minutes until golden - Once they are done, I would recommended putting them in a separate cooling rack if you have one
* I've tried combining this chicken with a mashed potatoes, but maybe some roasted potatoes are your best bet here!
