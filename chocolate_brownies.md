# Claire Saffitz Makes Malted "Forever" Brownies | Dessert Person

### Ingredients

20g cocoa powder
5 ounces / 142g semisweet chocolate chips (between 55% to 68% cacao)
85g unsalted butter (cut into small chunks)
1/4 cup rapeseed oil
100g caster sugar
100g light brown sugar
1 large egg
2 large egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
100g plain flour (3.5 oz / 100g)
1 teaspoon salt (0.11 oz / 3g)
1/4 cup boiling water

**optional:** 2 tablespoons malted milk powder (0.63 oz / 18g) - I use Ovomaltine

### Method

1. Cover the pan with tin foil and butter the bottom and sides
2. Bloom the cocoa with boiling water
3. Add the chocolate, oil and butter to a large glass bowl
4. Slowly heat up the bowl in a double-boiler. Stop when the mixture is smooth and the chocolate starts to melt
5. Take mixture off the heat and add both sugars
6. Add the eggs, vanilla, salt and milk powder (optional)
7. Mix, bake, etc...
8. Once the top is mostly settled and is starting to crack, it should be ready to take off
9. Let cool on the counter for a while. Transfer to the fridge once all the residual heat is gone

### Notes

- Bake at 180Â°C fan - 25 to 30 minutes
